      <h1>Content Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Caveart Webcomics is a platform that allows and encourages its users to express themselves through sequential art which may cover any number of genres and topics, as well as to curate their own reading experiences and communicate with fellow creators and readers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following standards are enforced by the admins.  Please abide by these rules not just by the letter of them but by their spirit as well.  These content policies apply to any form of content you upload, from comments to comics and their panels.  If you break the content policy, the surrounding context might solicit empathy from the mod team, but ultimately will not change the fact that you broke the content policy.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Do not incite or promote violence, hate, or criminal acts.</b>  There is a difference between a comic that depicts bigotry, hate or violence and comics that encourage the same.  Any comments made by people that themselves promote/incite such concepts are unacceptable no matter how justified you may personally feel to make them. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Your content should belong to you and/or your team, or else be uploaded with the creator's explicit permisison.</b> Content that you upload which was created by an uninvolved third party will be removed if we discover that it it was uploaded without the consent of the creator(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Respect the privacy of others.</b>  We will not tolerate any sharing or posting any content that includes personally identifiable information (PII) without explicit, written consent. This includes pictures, names, addresses and email addresses, peoples' workplaces, schools, birthdates, and literally any other private information. Any violation of this rule will result in the immediate removal of the content upon its discovery. If the consent is given by a minor, it doesn't meet our criteria for consent. No exceptions.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The content warnings on your comics must appropriately reflect its content.</b> Tagging your comic pages is optional, and helps you show up in searches, but they are notthe same thing as setting your comic's content warnings. Content warnings are not negotiable. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.</b>  Doing so is grounds for banning on the first offense.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Do not post or encourage the posting of beastiality content.</b> Content that depicts an animal (e.g. a feral) for the viewer's sexual gratification is beastiality content.  Sexual content that depicts anthropomorphized characters (not a feral) is not considered beastiality content.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Keep it legal.</b>  Posting illegal content or solicit or facilitate illegal activity is grounds for an immediate ban from the website.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Do not link to off-site content that violates our content policy.</b> We will remove attempts to use our platform to promote content that violates our policy.  We will curtail the permissions of users who repeatedly violate this rule. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We do not pro-actively monitor content uploaded to the platform.  Instead, we provide a reporting feature.  If you find material that is in violation of our content policy, please use our reporting feature to bring it to the attention of admins.
      </p>

      <p>We enforce our content policy the following ways depending on the circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asking you to remove the offending material within a time frame yourself before we remove it for you</li>
        <li>Removing it for you and issuing a first and final warning</li>
        <li>Removing your account privileges if you continue to violate the policy in ways that do not result in a ban</li>
        <li>Banning you for violating our TOS or the law</li>
      </ul>
