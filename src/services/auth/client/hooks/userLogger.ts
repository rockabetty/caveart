/**
 * This module is responsible for logging user-related actions in a structured
 * and consistent manner. By leveraging a series of predefined logging actions,
 * the system is able to provide detailed logs during development, and more concise
 * logs in production environments.
 * 
 * I personally recommend that you not feel too bad if your eyes glaze right
 * over when you read it because it's as dry as Luby's chicken breast.
 *
 * Regardless, the logger is designed to cater to two environments:
 * - Development: Detailed logs include specifics for debugging.
 * - Production: Brief logs that fail to be specific on purpose for security.
 *
 * Development is when you're typing away at your laptop at home, code forged
 * in goldfish crumbs and cathair, so it's okay to have all the details logged.
 * But production is when your code is available for anybody on the Internet to
 * mess with, including hackers who may leverage error information if you tell
 * them too much.
 * 
 * The decision between detailed and concise logs is made based on the `NODE_ENV`
 * environment variable, which is 'development' when you run `npm run dev`.
 *
 * There are several predefined logging actions, each handling a specific type of 
 * user action like login, logout, etc. The 'loggerMap' connects these log actions 
 * with their respective actionTypes to provide more streamlined logging.
 * 
 * As-is, the UserActionLogger is set up to automatically fire off without you 
 * doing anything to invoke it and all this documentation is for learning purposes. 
 *
 * @module UserActionLogger
 * 
 * @exports {Object} logActions - A set of predefined logging actions.
 * @exports {Object} loggerMap - A map connecting actionTypes to their respective log actions.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Assuming you have an action and payload:
 * const actionType = ActionType.Login;
 * const payload = { id: '123', source: 'web' };
 *
 * // Using loggerMap to log the action:
 * const logAction = loggerMap[actionType];
 * if (logAction) {
 *   logAction(payload);
 * }
