/**
 * UserProvider Component
 *
 * This component serves as a context provider for user authentication. It provides
 * functions for logging in, logging out, verifying a user, and viewing a user profile.
 * It manages the user authentication state using the userReducer.
 *
 * If you want to use these functions, you actually are in the wrong place.  This file
 * defines how these functions act under the hood and are subject to change!  You want
 * to go to 'useUser', which is a more 'stable' file that exposes these functions in a
 * more user-friendly manner.
 *
 * @component
 * @example
 * return (
 *   <UserProvider>
 *     <YourComponent />
 *   </UserProvider>
 * )
